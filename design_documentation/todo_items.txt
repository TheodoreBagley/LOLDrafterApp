THIS IS A LIST OF ALL ITEMS THAT NEED TO DONE. EACH SECTION OF THE APPLICATION WILL HAVE SEGREGATED TODO'S TO MAKE IT EASIER TO NAVIGATE AND TRACK WHAT HAS BEEN WORKED ON AND WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE AND WHERE. 

WHEN YOU COMPLETE A TODO REPLACE THE QUESTION MARK (?) WITH AN EXCLAMATION POINT(!) AND PROVIDE THE FILE THE CHANGE WAS MADE AND WHERE THE NEW CODE IS LOCATED IN THE FILE. BE SURE TO PUT YOUR NAME AFTER THE EXCLAMATION POINT(!)

MAKE SURE ALL CHANGES HAVE COMMENTS IN THE FILE THAT ARE UNDERSTANDABLE

ALL DEPENDENCIES AND PACKAGES SHOULD BE REPORTED IN REQUIREMENTS ADN AT THE END OF THE COMPLETED TODO IN THIS FILE

FEEL FREE TO ADD NEW TODO'S AS YOU THINK OF THEM OR WHEN YOU NEED TO REMEMBER WHERE YOU LEFT OFF

WEB SCRAPE:

? PROPERLY SCRAPE WHEN THERE ARE 2 SECTIONS OF INFORMATION FOR DIFFERENT ROLES ON ONE CHAMPION. FOR REFERENCE: https://www.counterstats.net/league-of-legends/brand THERE ARE 2 SECTIONS BUT THE WIN RATES PORTION FOR BRAND IN THE champions.db FILE ONLY SHOWS SUPPORT WIN RATES

? LOOK INTO FINDING A PLACE TO GET COMPLEMENTARY WIN RATES (WIN RATES BETWEN 2 CHAMPIONS ON THE SAME TEAM). 

? ADD COMPLEMENTARY WIN RATES TO DATA BASE

DATA BASE: 

? TRANSFER DATA FROM PEE WEE TO DJANGE ORM

DESGIN: 

? MAKE DESIGN OF BROWSER WINDOW

? DETERMINE HOW THE FULL DATABASE AND THE NECESSARY MODELS SHOULD LOOK LIKE

? BRAINSTORM CSS IDEAS

? PLAN THE REST OF THE STACK FOR THE FULL WEB APP
